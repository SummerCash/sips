The SummerCash Improvement Proposals repository.

## Rationale

The term "SIP" refers to "SummerCash Improvement Proposal."
SIPs are, temporarily, the main governance model for the SummerCash network.
A SIP can address any issue regarding SummerCash, or the use of SummerCash at SummerTech.
Once a SIP has been created and validated, it will be appended to all available "SIPs" display lists
(i.e. SummerCash page, governance tab in mobile wallet). A stake-based vote will then occur
regarding the SIP. After the 72 hour voting period, the SIP will be deemed "accepted,"
and implemented in any available repositories (i.e. pull request).
